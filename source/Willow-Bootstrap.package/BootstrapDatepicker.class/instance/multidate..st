multidate: aBooleanOrNumber

	"Boolean, Number. Default: false

Enable multidate picking. Each date in month view acts as a toggle button, keeping track of which dates the user has selected in order. If a number is given, the picker will limit how many dates can be selected to that number, dropping the oldest dates from the list when the number is exceeded. true equates to no limit. The inputâ€™s value (if present) is set to a string generated by joining the dates, formatted, with multidateSeparator."
